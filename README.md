# ML-Projects "Practice Makes Perfect 📈✨"

Welcome to my collection of Machine Learning Projects! Here, I practice and showcase various ML models and techniques. Let's dive in! 🚀

## 📊 1. Diabetes Classification

### Project Overview

This beginner-friendly project involves classifying diabetes status using the **Pima Indians Diabetes Database** with a simple neural network.

## 🚢 2. Titanic Classification | A Data Leakage-Free Approach ✅

### Project Overview

In this project, we perform data preprocessing and complex imputation methods based on other non-null variables to prepare the dataset for analysis. We conduct extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to extract new features, including:

| Feature                    | Description                                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title from Names**       | Extracting titles (Mr, Mrs, Miss, etc.) from names.   |
| **IsAlone Feature**        | Binary feature indicating if a passenger is alone.    |
| **Categorization of Age**  | Transforming continuous age into categorical ranges.  |
| **Categorization of Fare** | Transforming continuous fare into categorical ranges. |

**Imputation and Feature Engineering**: We apply these techniques only on the training data, using the same transformations on the validation/test data without accessing target information.

### Model Evaluation

After feature extraction, we select the most appropriate features and create a validation split to evaluate various models, including:

- **Logistic Regression**: `LogisticRegression()`
- **XGBoost**: `XGBClassifier()`
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: `SVC()`
- **Decision Tree**: `DecisionTreeClassifier()`
- **Random Forest**: `RandomForestClassifier()`
- **Naive Bayes**: `GaussianNB()`
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: `KNeighborsClassifier()`
- Using the **F1-score** for evaluation, we cannot rely on accuracy as a metric due to the **data imbalance problem** in the dataset. The F1-score provides a better measure of a model's performance, particularly in imbalanced situations, as it considers both precision and recall—the harmonic mean of these two metrics. We identify the best **4** models and perform **hyperparameter tuning** on `XGBoost`, `Random Forest`, and `Decision Tree` using Grid Search. We also visualize feature importances to gain insights and save predictions for submission to the **Kaggle competition**. 🏆
